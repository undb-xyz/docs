An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for data tables is a graphical representation that illustrates the relationships between data tables. It uses entities (tables) and relationships (connections between entities) to present the structure of a database.

Undb also provides an ERD feature for each data table, allowing users to visualize the connections and associations between data tables, facilitating a better understanding of the structure of the database and the relationships between data.

You can view the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of this table by clicking the "More" icon next to the table name, opening the dropdown menu, and selecting the "ERD" option.
