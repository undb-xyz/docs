## Lookup

### Using a lookup field

**Lookup fields are read-only fields. When creating a lookup field you can choose a ‘Link to table’ field in the same table and a field in the related table.**

## Count

**The Count field is used to count the number of matching entries in the referenced table for the unique key (foreign key) referenced by the current row. It helps users to understand the usage of this unique key in the referenced table, and make correct data decisions accordingly.**
