## Token

### Auth Token

The auth Token, also known as an authentication token, is a token used for authentication and authorization purposes on the Undb platform. It serves as a credential for users, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and utilize the platform's features and resources. By adding `AUTHORIZATIONS: Bearer-{Auth Token}` to the request header, the platform can verify the user's identity.

The method to obtain the auth Token in the Undb system can be found in the user settings menu. Simply open the user settings menu and click on "auth Token" to successfully copy the JWT Token used for user authentication in the Undb system.

### API Token

The presence of both `auth Token` and `API Token` in the system serves the purpose of providing a more flexible authentication and authorization mechanism to cater to different needs and permission levels. The `API Token`, which is generated by users, is used for direct authentication and authorization of user identity. If an API Token is included in the request, it is used for authentication; otherwise, the `auth Token` is used. This design enhances the security and usability of the system.

**_How to obtain an API Token?_**

In the user settings menu bar, go to Settings, where you can manually create an API Token by clicking on `Create New Token`. Click on the copy icon to copy the value of the API Token.

**The usage of API Token for identity verification is to add `x-undb-api-token: API Token` in the header information of the API call.**
