### Add user authentication

There are two ways to add user authentication.

- #### copy auth token

When making an API request, it is necessary to add the Authorization information to the request headers, in which the auth Token of the system user should be filled in as bearerAuth.

The following GIF animation demonstrates how to obtain an auth token. Please refer to it:

- ### Create API Token

Create an `API Token` in the `Settings` page. Then add `x-undb-api-token: API Token` to the request header. Note: API Token authentication takes precedence, and if the API Token authentication is successful, the user's identity will not be verified using the Auth Token. If the authentication fails, the interface will not return detailed information.

### Postman

You can choose to download the JSON format file in "Postman Collections" below.

Please import the file downloaded just now directly into the Postman application.

If you choose to authenticate using an Auth Token, set the bearer token as the copied user token in this collection.
