## What is Field?

**A table consists of rows and fields (columns). The rows and fields, also known as columns, are visible in the grid view. In a table, a field is a collection of values of the same data type. Each field is a data structure that holds a defined data type.**

**A field can store lots of different types of data, but importantly it can only store one type of information and not a mix. Fields have different data types, such as text, numbers, dates, boolean, collaborators, select and URL:**

## Create Field

- To create a new field, you can click on the + button just after the last visible field at the end of the table. Next, select the field type and input a name to identify the field. Click Create.
