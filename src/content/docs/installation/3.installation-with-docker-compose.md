Learn how to deploy `undb` with a simple docker compose command

## run undb with docker compose

to run undb with docker compose, you should create a `docker-compose.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
version: '3.0'
services:
  undb:
    image: ghcr.io/undb-xyz/undb:latest
    container_name: undb
    volumes:
      - ~/.undb/:/var/opt/.undb
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
```

and then run `docker-compose up` to get undb started

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The command above will run undb in the background and expose port `4000`, and you can visit `http://localhost:4000` and get started

## Volumes

Note that `undb` data will be saved in `~/.undb/` on your local machine
